1. There are many types of RINEX files.
     Almost every issue is because of some corner case with a particular RINEX format.
     Thus we will usually need a copy of your RINEX file.
     If it's very large/private, consider copying just the part of it that causes the issue for you.

2. Please copy and paste the error--usually just the bottom couple lines is enough.
